## Notes

One of the weird challenges I have encountered in this second step was definitely the part where I had to code the logic for the empty search bar. When the search bar was empty, I needed to display everything and when the search bar had some text, I should display the related items, and if a user searches with an empty search bar, I wanted to return everything. Except for coding that logic, everything else was pretty straightforward.
