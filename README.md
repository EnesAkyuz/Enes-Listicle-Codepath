## Notes

The main challenge I encountered was that I could not figure out the safe closing option for the ports. I tried to code a safe close and safe open functions to keep the ports unoccupied but it did not seem to work well. Still, I left them in the code since they did not affect or break any working components of the codebase. The second hard part was basically styling things without any frameworks or downloadable libraries (PicoCSS is great but readily available cards are also great!). However, AI tools helped a lot on that side. The last part was to make the website feel full. I think it is a me problem but I just did not feel like I had much content to make the website feel full or functional. However, I think this is very minor. Other than that, the whole coding process was pretty smooth. I rarely had any bumps.
